The “Performance and Sustainability Management in Modern Data Centers” project, led by Ricardo Macedo (INESC TEC), focuses on designing new computer systems and techniques to meet the performance, reliability, and environmental sustainability of modern data centers. The project is guided by three primary goals. First, it seeks to harness cutting-edge technologies present in modern data centers --- such as persistent memory, CXL, resource disaggregation, among others --- to design the next generation of storage, memory, and network systems. These advancements aim to improve the performance of large-scale applications and workloads, such as LLM training and inference, scientific simulations, and data-centric applications. Second, the project explores new software-driven approaches to balance the application performance and the energy consumption and carbon footprint of data center infrastructures, using dynamic frequency scaling, thermal management and cooling system control, and carbon-aware scheduling. Finally, the project aims to bridge the gap between research and real-world application by creating accessible, well-tested solutions tailored to the challenges faced in production environments, promoting adoption by academia and industry.
