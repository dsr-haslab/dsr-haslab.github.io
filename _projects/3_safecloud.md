Cloud infrastructures, despite all their advantages and importance to the competitiveness of modern economies, raise fundamental questions related to the privacy, integrity, and security of offsite data storage and processing tasks. There are major privacy and security concerns about data located in the cloud, especially when data is physically located, processed, or must transit outside the legal jurisdiction of its rightful owner. These questions are currently not answered satisfactorily by existing technologies. [SafeCloud](http://www.safecloud-project.eu) will re-architect cloud infrastructures to ensure secure and private data transmission, storage, and processing.
