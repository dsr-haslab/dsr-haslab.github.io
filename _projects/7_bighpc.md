The [BigHPC](http://bighpc.inesctec.pt) project will provide a novel management framework, for Big Data and parallel computing workloads, that can be seamlessly integrated with existing HPC infrastructures and software stacks. The project will research, develop and integrate new monitoring, virtualization, and storage management components that can cope with the infrastructural scale and heterogeneity, as well as, the different workload requirements, while ensuring the best performance and resource usage for both applications and infrastructures.

In the project our team is doing research on a novel SDS solution that: 1) can cope with highly dynamic and heterogeneous applications and workloads; 2) is able to minimize the performance interference of different applications storing and retrieving information concurrently from shared resources; 3) is able to sustain both high-throughput and low-latency according to the requirements of each application.
