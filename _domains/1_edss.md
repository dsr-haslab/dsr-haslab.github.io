brief_description: Storage systems are critical for the efficiency of data-centric applications (e.g., AI, analytics, databases) and large-scale services (e.g., Cloud, HPC). DSR designs new storage solutions and optimizations that meet the performance, scale, dependability, and security demands of traditional and emerging data-centric workloads.
summary: Data is currently one of the most important assets of our society, given its significance for a wide range of critical services and sectors (e.g., healthcare, e-governance, finance, natural sciences).<br><br>While the hardware and software for processing vast and heterogeneous amounts of data have been advancing rapidly, the same is not valid for storage counterparts. However, storage solutions (e.g., block devices, file systems, object stores) provide the cornerstone for persisting and accessing digital information, meaning that their efficiency is paramount to fully leveraging the advancements in data processing.<br><br>Our research aims to build efficient storage solutions tailored to the performance, dependability, and security demands of emerging applications (e.g., AI, analytics, databases) and large-scale infrastructures (e.g., cloud computing, high-performance computing).
goals:
  - name: Adaptable and extensible storage systems
    description: We research solutions that break from the monolithic design of traditional storage systems, which struggle to accommodate heterogeneous and emerging workloads. By building extendable storage systems that incorporate novel optimizations and features, chosen and tailored at runtime, we aim to improve data management for a broader range of applications and services.
  - name: Transparent and tailored storage features
    description: We research storage features individually (e.g., load-balancing, caching, deduplication, scheduling) and at scale to ensure better management of storage resources and better quality of service for cloud computing and HPC infrastructures. As a fundamental principle, we design transparent and non-intrusive optimizations for the different applications leveraging our solutions.
  - name: Dependability and security
    description: We design storage systems that are resilient and adaptable to environments with different levels of instability and failures (e.g., private servers, data centers, IoT). Also, we design efficient solutions that transparently ensure the privacy and security of data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, trusted hardware ) when stored in untrusted third-party services and under threats (e.g., ransomware attacks).
