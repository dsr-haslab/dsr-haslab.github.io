<h2>HASLab CENTER</h2>
<hr>

The High-Assurance Software Laboratory (HASLab) is one of the integrated R&D centers of [INESC TEC](https://www.inesctec.pt/en), a leading national associate laboratory, and a teaching and research subunit of the [University of Minho](https://www.uminho.pt/EN), where it is headquartered.

Research at HASLab is anchored on a rigorous approach to three areas of Computer Science: **Software Engineering**, **Distributed Systems** and **Cryptography and Information Security**. The laboratory's contributions to these areas range from fundamental research on formal methods and algorithms to applied research on tools and middleware that address real-world demands stemming from long-term collaborations with industry.
