description: Open-source I/O benchmark suitable for evaluating deduplication systems.

---

[DEDISbench](https://github.com/jtpaulo/dedisbench) is an open-source micro I/O benchmark suitable for evaluating deduplication systems by generating blocks with a realistic content distribution. The benchmark also allows running tests with different load intensities and introduces a novel hotspot access pattern for I/O requests.
