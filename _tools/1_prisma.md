description: storage data plane for DL frameworks
---

[Prisma](https://github.com/dsrhaslab/prisma) is a storage data plane that accelerates the training performance of Deep Learning (DL) frameworks. It implements a parallel data prefetching mechanism that reads training data in advance and stores it in an in-memory buffer to serve incoming I/O requests of DL frameworks. Work led by Cl√°udia Correia.
