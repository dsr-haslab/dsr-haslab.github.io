[S2Dedup](https://github.com/mmm97/S2Dedup) is a trusted hardware-based privacy-preserving deduplication system designed to support multiple security schemes that enable different levels of performance, security guarantees and space savings. Such feature is key to ensure S2Dedupâ€™s applicability to a wider range of applications with different requirements. The proposed solution leverages Intel Software Guard Extensions to enable cross-user privacy-preserving deduplication at third-party storage infrastructures.
