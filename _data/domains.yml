  brief_description: Researching efficient and reliable storage solutions involves evaluating the performance, resilience, and security of these systems. DSR is committed to designing and developing advanced benchmarking and observability tools to accurately assess storage systems and data-centric applications, providing valuable insights for continuous improvement.
  summary: As the complexity of modern storage solutions and data-centric applications grows, ensuring their efficiency, resiliency, and security becomes increasingly challenging. <br><br>Traditional benchmarking and observability tools often fall short of thoroughly assessing the intricate performance aspects of these advanced systems. This gap makes it difficult to identify weaknesses, optimize performance, and guarantee data integrity and security in these increasingly complex environments.<br><br>Our research in the domain of Benchmarking and Observability aims to address the aforementioned challenges by developing robust tools and methodologies specifically tailored for modern storage solutions and data-centric applications.

  brief_description: Optimizing AI for systems and systems for AI workloads has become one of the most enticing routes for research as models and data grow and storage configurations may be suboptimal under volatile workloads.  With this, AIS's goal is threefold. First, it aims to design novel storage optimizations for AI workloads. Second, it seeks to find optimal storage configurations while resorting to AI (i.e., by fine-tuning typical storage mechanisms such as compression, data deduplication, or security degrees). Third, it aims to optimize LLMs in heterogeneous hierarchies.
  summary: The challenge of efficiently managing the rapid growth of AI models and data, alongside volatile workloads, emphasizes the need for advanced storage solutions. Addressing this, our research focuses on three main areas. First, we aim to design novel storage optimizations tailored for AI workloads, improving the handling of large and complex datasets. Second, we strive to identify optimal storage configurations by leveraging AI techniques, enhancing storage efficiency and security. Third, we focus on optimizing large language models (LLMs) within heterogeneous hierarchies to ensure efficient operation across complex and modern computing environments. These research lines are crucial for advancing AI system capabilities amidst increasing demands and complexity.
