The ["Efficient and Secure Data Management for HPC and Cloud Computing"](http://www.globalcentra.org/projects/#prv) project aims at researching novel data management solutions for Cloud and HPC distributed environments. These solutions must be efficient, secure, and practical by: 1) alleviating any storage or processing performance bottlenecks identified for data-centric applications deployed on HPC and Cloud services; 2) following a privacy-by-design approach when storing and processing sensitive data on third-party infrastructures; and 3) re-using stable and industry-adopted storage systems, databases and analytical platforms. 
Currently, the project contemplates solutions for file systems, SQL and NoSQL databases, as well as analytical and AI platforms. The ambition of this project is to leverage collaboration between CENTRA partners, as well as other researchers, that are interested in these research areas and/or have good use-cases for validating the project’s outcomes.

Project team members include: INESC TEC (Portugal): João Paulo, Ricardo Macedo, Tânia Esteves, Cláudia Brito, and Cláudia Correia; AIST (Japan): Yusuke Tanimura, Jason Haga; KISTI (S. Korea): Woojin Seok. 

External Collaborations: UT Austin (USA): Vijay Chidambaram; TACC (USA): Weijia Xu.
